<H1>GAMING BLOG</H1>
<p>Gaming blog,This blog is one of the most famous and favourite of mine and everybody's.Games our also good for our  mind,it makes our mind more active and sharper.Gaming is more popular now than ever before and it’s the perfect time to launch your own gaming blog.New game studios pop up all the time and they’re always looking to collab with bloggers & game journalists. Gaming blogs are great because they offer news coverage, game reviews, and press.

Thankfully it’s also easier than ever to launch your own gaming blog from scratch. But this can be a daunting task if you have no idea where to start.

In this guide I’ll walk you through a complete step-by-step guide for launching your own gaming blog. Every step is laid out with plenty of screenshots so anybody should be able to follow along with ease.</p>
<p>This process can be confusing if you don’t know what you’re doing. My hope is to break it down into bite-size chunks so that anyone can follow along.

First let’s take a peek at the major steps in this guide and what you’ll need to launch a gaming blog. Here’s a breakdown:

1 Register a domain name + hosting account
2 Install WordPress
3 Customize your new blog
4 Install a gaming blog theme
5 Add some vital WordPress plugins
6 The first two steps are the most technical and they’re also the reason most people shy away.

But if you really want to get into gaming journalism then launching your own blog is the fastest way to get started. You can make a name for yourself and even network with others in the industry to make connections in game studios around the world.

All you need to do is get a site online and start building content. Easier said than done, but this guide should make it a bit easier to do.

If you follow along and have some patience you can start a successful gaming blog. Anybody could do this. The problem is that very few try.But we need to ahve balance between games and studies,because both are important.</p>
<p>The first step is to think of a name for your blog. This will be your domain name and it’s how readers access your blog online.

For example, the Destructoid blog owns destructoid.com which is their domain name.

You’ll want to find something similar. Ideally a .com name that’s short and sweet. It doesn’t even have to mention gaming. It can just be a branded word or phrase, sorta like this site you’re on is named WhatPixel.</p>
